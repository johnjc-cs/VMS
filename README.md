The file includes three datasets: Table S1 is the original dataset, Table S2 is the processed dataset, and Table S3 is the blind test set.
It also contains seven Jupyter notebook code source files, with the algorithm models and datasets used labeled in the file names.
"KNN_T-vms_5", "SVM_T-vms_5", and "RF_T-vms_5" are the source codes for classification using KNN, SVM, and RF algorithms respectively, with the dataset being "T-vms".     	"RF_F-vms_2" and "RF_M-vms_3" are the source codes for classification using the RF algorithm, with the datasets being "F-vms" and "M-vms" respectively.
"RF_test_5" and "RF_test_2" are the source codes for classification prediction using the blind test set.
